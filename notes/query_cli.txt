A new --query command-line option allows other tools to easily read raptor's
configuration data without having to understand exactly how raptor config
files work. The output is presented in XML format.

For example, all the valid build aliases which can be used to build with
the -c option can be obtained using:

sbs --query=aliases

All the known product variants can be obtained using:

sbs --query=products

In both cases, the output is sorted by name attribute.

The details of a particular configuration can be found using:

sbs --query=config[armv5_urel.n8]

The following information is also printed for configurations:

1. include paths used for preprocessing bld.infs and MMPs
2. pre-include header file for preprocessing bld.infs and MMPs
3. pre-include header file passed to the compiler in a build (if used)
4. macros used to preprocess bld.infs and MMPs (with values, if explicitly set)
5. core macros used in compilation preprocessing (with values, if explicitly set)
6. available values to use as the targettype in MMP

To obtain a list of available filters, use

sbs --query=filters

This also prints Python docstrings for each filter, where available.
