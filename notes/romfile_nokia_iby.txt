The ROMFILE global target now supports the generation of .iby files that
make use of newer, "Nokia format", macros.

The new files are generated by default into the same location as the older,
"Symbian format", files but with the addition of "n" within the filename.
In the general case, the following .iby files are now created in response to
ROMFILE for a component's release and test builds:

    $EPOCROOT/epoc32/rom/path/to/component/bldinf/platform.iby
    $EPOCROOT/epoc32/rom/path/to/component/bldinf/platformn.iby 
    $EPOCROOT/epoc32/rom/path/to/component/bldinf/platformtest.iby
    $EPOCROOT/epoc32/rom/path/to/component/bldinf/platformtestn.iby    

For example, the default test ROMFILE output for e32test is now:

    M:\epoc32\rom\sf\os\kernelhwsrv\kerneltest\e32test\group\armv5test.iby
    M:\epoc32\rom\sf\os\kernelhwsrv\kerneltest\e32test\group\armv5testn.iby

The following functional differences exist between the previous "non-n" and
the new "n" files:

    Symbian                    Nokia
    -------                    -----
    device[MAGIC]              device[VARID]
    /epoc32/release/##KMAIN##  ABI_DIR
    ##BUILD##                  BUILD_DIR

In addition to the auto-generation of Nokia format files, Raptor now ships
an FLM that allows custom entries to be appended to the vanilla Raptor
generated .iby files as part of ROMFILE operation.  It can be used as follows:

    PRJ_[TEST]EXTENSIONS
    START EXTENSION utility.append_iby
	OPTION IBY_TYPE    NOKIA|SYMBIAN
	OPTION APPEND_FILE text_file_content_to_append.txt
    END
    
IBY_TYPE is optional and defaults to NOKIA if unspecified.
APPEND_FILE is assumed to be a text file, and is located relative to the
bld.inf file.

Multiple "START EXTENSION utility.append_iby" blocks can exist that target the
same .iby file.  However, the order of application of these files cannot be
guaranteed, so file content should not be sensitive in this way.

For example, to append the content of a component local nokia_test.txt file
to the <platform>testn.iby files created by Raptor:

    PRJ_TESTEXTENSIONS
    START EXTENSION utility.append_iby
	OPTION APPEND_FILE iby_appends/nokia_test.txt
    END
