Linker --remove enables removal of unused sections from ELF binaries.
This option was enabled by default in the RVCT builds in 2.17.3 but as of
2.17.4 it has been disabled temporarily as some DLLs have reported runtime
problems with it enabled.  The "remove_unused_sections" variant is available
to switch it back on again e.g. via the apply keyword in an mmp ("apply
remove_unused_sections") or added to the configuration name on the commandline
(e.g. -c armv5.generic.remove_unused_sections").
