The --query command-line option has been extended to print more detailed
information about a given configuration.

Querying aliases, now prints the list in sorted order, by name attribute.
Ditto for products.

Querying a configuration now prints the following additional information:

1. include paths used for preprocessing bld.inf's and MMP's
2. pre-include header file for preprocessing bld.inf's and MMP's
3. pre-include header file passed to the compiler in a build (if used)
4. macros used to preprocess bld.inf's and MMP's (with values, if explicitly set)
5. core macros used in compilation preprocessing (with values, if explicitly set)
