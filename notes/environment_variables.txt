This file lists the environment variables that Raptor detects and their 
purpose. In some cases, when an environment variable is not set in the 
environment, Raptor will give it a default value which is also listed.

Name:           SBS_HOME
Default:        The directory containing the bin\sbs.bat batch file on 
                Windows; the directory containing the bin/sbs Bash shell 
                script on Linux. 
Description:    Location for Raptor's script, FLMs, configuration files, 
                and certain supporting utilities. 
Versions:       Optional from Raptor v2.9.0; essential for earlier versions.
Platforms:      All

Name:           SBS_CYGWIN_TMP
Default:        %TEMP%
Description:    Location for Cygwin's /tmp directory; Cygwin's default 
                value for this is %TEMP% which can cause problems in 
                cluster builds. Set SBS_CYGWIN_TMP to point to an existing 
                directory that can be made available to all nodes in a 
                cluster build. Must be a full path including drive letter.
