Filter to generate Bash shell scripts from a Raptor build log.

The ShellScriptsFilter takes the following named parameters: "name" and "file"
"name" specifies the name attribute of a recipe tag to parse for
"file" specifies a "command file", which has one "name" per line

Recipe names specified in command files come after all recipes specified
with the filter's "name" parameter, but the order of the recipes in the
command file is maintained.

E.g.

sbs_filter --filters=ShellScriptsFilter[name=compile,name=linkandpostlink] < a_raptor_log.log

generates the files 

rebuild.sh - calls the shell scripts below in the order given in the filter's parameter list
compile.sh - contains command from all "compile" recipes
linkandpostlink.sh - contains commands from "linkandpostlink" recipes

sbs_filter --filters=ShellScriptsFilter[file=recipes.txt] < a_raptor_log.log

recipes.txt has the format
----------------------
name=compile
name=linkandpostlink
----------------------

generates the files 

rebuild.sh - calls the shell scripts below in the order given in the filter's parameter list
compile.sh - contains command from all "compile" recipes
linkandpostlink.sh - contains commands from "linkandpostlink" recipes
 
The ShellScriptsFilter can also be used during a build by specifying it alongside other filters 
in the sbs command line.
