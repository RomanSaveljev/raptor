Use the filter_EXEs filter to generate a set of files listing the EXEs created
in a build.  A separate file will be created for each layer name and each
configuration containing EXEs.  The filter can be run on an existing log file
as follows:

sbs_filter --filter=filter_exes[] < logfile

By default it will create the files in the current directory, named
'<layer>_<config>.txt' e.g. 'layerone_armv5_urel.txt'.  If layers are not in
use (e.g. the build was not based on a system definition) the layer name used
will be 'nolayer' - e.g. 'nolayer_armv5_udeb.txt'.

The location for output files can be overridden using the 'output' argument.
To limit its operation to specified layers or configs, the 'layer' and 'config'
arguments can be supplied, multiple times if necessary:

sbs_filter --filter=filter_exes[output=mydir,layer=layerone,layer=layertwo,config=armv5_urel] < logfile

The files contain a list of filenames with no paths and no other information.

Note that argument names may be abbreviated e.g.

sbs_filter --filter=filter_exes[o=mydir,l=layerone,c=armv5_urel] < logfile
