Lowercasing for resources, including rsg and rsc files, is not supported in Raptor.
If it causes build errors on Linux, people should fix case issues in their source 
code and metadata, and keep case consistent.

But because Raptor used to support this feature, option "--use-rsg-casefolding"
is provided for people to use tempararily, so they could continue to build
their code on Linux before they fixed all the case issues in their code. However,
they should not use this option as a permanent work around.

Usage: By default resource files are not case folding, to enable it use option "--use-rsg-casefolding"

This does not affect build on Windows.
