Lowercasing for resources, including rsg and rsc files, are not support in Raptor.
If it causes build errors on Linux, people should fix case issues in their source 
code and keep case consistent.

But because Raptor used to support this feature, option "--resource_rsg_casefolding"

their code on Linux before they fixed all the case issues in their code. However,
they should not use this option as a permanent work around.

Usage: --resource_rsg_casefolding on


This doesn't affact build on Windows.
