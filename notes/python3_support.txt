Python 3 Support
==================

Python 3 is a major update to the Python programming language.
Raptor now supports being run with Python 3.1.x or 3.2.x as well 
as Python 2.6.5 and up.

How to use Python 3 with Raptor
--------------------------------

Set the variable SBS_PYTHON3 before running raptor e.g.
on Linux -
   export SBS_PYTHON3=/usr/bin/python3 
or Windows -
   set SBS_PYTHON3=e:\apps\python321\python.exe

Raptor will then use python 3 for running itself. Note
that if SBS_PYTHON is also set then SBS_PYTHON3 takes 
precedence and Raptor will still run under Python 3.

Python scripts that are run in the main build e.g mifconv.py
are still executed with Python 2 (as specified by the "SBS_PYTHON" variable).

Python 3 Benefits
------------------

Python 3 supports a number of programming features that are of interest
to Raptor e.g.

* PEP 3148, a new futures library for concurrent programming 
* an overhauled GIL implementation that reduces
  contention

These features make it possible to solve problems and do so quickly.
