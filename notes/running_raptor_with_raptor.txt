Running Raptor from Raptor
============================

If a Function-like Makefile (FLM) needs to run raptor for some reason
then it should use the $(SBS) variable to do so and MUST NOT try to run
sbs directly.  The problem would be that on windows, direct usage of
the "sbs" command causes the bash sbs shell-script to be executed rather
than sbs.bat and this does not work in the main builds done on a cluster
although it might work on someones individual desktop PC.

The SBS variable is included in the root interface so that no FLM needs
to specify it in its own interface - it's just there.

An example: in some test code the FLM generates test mmps using the
EXPORT target and these can then only be built in the same build by
invoking a sub-instance of raptor.

mybld.inf: 
	$(call startrule,geninf)
	echo -e "PRJ_MMPFILES\nmymmp.mmp\n" >$@
	$(call endrule,geninf)

# CORRECT:
mygoodbuild: mybld.inf
	$(call startrule,dobuild)
	$(SBS) -b mybld.inf
	$(call endrule,dobuild)

# INCORRECT: 
mybadbuild: mybld.inf
	$(call startrule,dobuild)
	sbs -b mybld.inf
	$(call endrule,dobuild)
