From bug 114 it appears that most control characters are not allowed in CDATA
sections. The XML spec says that only CTRL-I, CTRL-J and CTRL-M are allowed in
the range ASCII 0-31. The rules for other ranges vary between XML 1.0 and
XML 1.1 which is nasty, but probably irrelevant for us.

A quick test shows that the Python XML parser raises "not well-formed" exceptions
for any control character (except I,J,M) in a CDATA section.

So, we need to make sure that ASCII 0-31 is converted to something else
in CDATA sections. There is a curses.ascii module which has functions for testing
and converting control characters. CTRL-A becomes the string "^A" etc.

Applying this conversion inside the raptor_make.XMLEscapeLog function seems like
a good bet. Since that already does escaping for "outside recipe" text and
keeping all the conversions in one place is good. Copying strings in Python may
be slow, but copies should be rare since we don't expect many of these control
characters to be appearing.
