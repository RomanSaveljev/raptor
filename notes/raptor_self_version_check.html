<h1>Raptor self version check</h1>
Starting with 2.16.16, Raptor has the capability to validate its own version 
against a regular expression specified in the SDK. This regular expression 
defines a range of versions of Raptor deemed compatible.<br/><br/>
In addition to this, SDK creators can also specify a version description 
message that is displayed to users when using an incompatible version.<br/> 

<h2>Usage</h2>
The recommendation is that the 'generic' variant in the XML file in 
epoc32/sbs_config/ is extended to enable the version check. To do this, an 
'env' tag should be added as a child element of the 'generic' variant. This 
'env' tag must specify the following attributes and values:
<br/>
<br/>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" >
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'name'</td>
<td>'SBS'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'type'</td>
<td>'tool'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'versionCommand'</td>
<td>'$(SBS) --version'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'versionResult'</td>
<td>A regular expression matching the required versions. It is an error if<br/>
the version of the currently running version of Raptor does not match this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'versionDescMsg'</td>
<td>A message to display to users if the version check fails</td>
</tr>
</table> 
<br/>
<br/>
Below is an example of an 'env' attribute (with one attribute per line for 
clarity):</br>
<pre>
&lt;env 
name='SBS' 
type='tool' 
versionCommand='$(SBS) --version' 
versionResult='2\.17\.[0-9]+' 
versionDescMsg='This version of Raptor is not suitable for this SDK.' 
/&gt;
</pre>

In this example, the 'versionResult' attribute specifies that any of the 
versions 2.17.x can be used with the SDK. The 'versionDescMsg' attribute's 
value could be extended to give more specific details.

<h2>Command line usage</h2>
In the SDK's, the 'armv5' group is redefined to have the 'generic' variant on 
by default. The effect of this is that any build that uses the 'generic' 
variant will have the Raptor self version check by default.
<br/><br/>
An error is always raised if the version check fails. If '-k' is passed to 
Raptor, the build will continue, and without '-k', the build will stop.

<h2>Note</h2>
Starting with 2.16.4, the sbs.bat and sbs shell scripts set the SBS 
environment variable, so it is available in the build, and in particular 
for the version check.
