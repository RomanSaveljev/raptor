Running Raptor Using the 'sbs' Command
---------------------------------------

Raptor is started from the commandline using the "sbs" command.  From the
windows cmd shell prompt this causes "sbs.bat" to be executed and from
the bash shell (on Windows or Linux) the "sbs" shellscript is executed.
The python components of Raptor are then started up by whichever of
these two scripts is run.


Automatic SBS_HOME Detection
-----------------------------

Raptor needs to be able to find its supporting files, e.g. configuration
files and python components.  In versions 2.17.0 and prior the SBS_HOME
environment variable could optionally be set to locate these files.
In later versions 2.17.0 it the value is automatically deduced from the
path to the sbs script or batch file. This prevents confusion when 
more than one version of Raptor is installed.

The sbs startup scripts normally reside in SBS_HOME/bin so they assume
that SBS_HOME is the directory one up from where they themselves are
located.  This makes it easier to set up Raptor as one only has to add
the raptor "/bin" directory to the user's PATH environment variable -
something that has to be done anyhow.


Running Raptor in a Python debugger
------------------------------------

Since version 2.17.1 it is possible to excecute Raptor using "python
bin/sbs.py" which makes it easier to run Raptor in a python debugger
without having to set up any environment variables first.  All that's
required is that the version of python should be suitable
(preferably 2.7.x or 3.2.x).
