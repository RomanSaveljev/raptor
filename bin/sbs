# Description:
# raptor script
# add mingw to the PATH if we are running Cygwin on Windows
#

# work SBS_HOME out from the path to this script
export SBS="$0" # Link to sbs script itself (needed by programs that run sub-instances of raptor)
SBS_HOME=$(cd ${SBS%/*}/.. && echo $PWD)
export SBS_HOME

# Call sbs_env script
source $SBS_HOME/bin/sbs_env

# The SBS variable is used as a way to create sub-invocations of raptor.
# If we're using cygwin then SBS needs, paradoxically, to refer to the 
# batch file rather than this shell script even though this is inconsistent.
# The tools that need the SBS variable the most like parallel parsing and 
# FLMs tend to fail e.g. on clustered builds where the difference in cygwin
# mount locations between the make and "build" machines causes 
# the #!/bin/sh at the top of this script to not resolve to the correct 
# location of "sh".  Only the batch file can be used in these situations.
